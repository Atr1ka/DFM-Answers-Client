# DFM-Answers-Client
The client side version of my DrFrostMaths.com answer script. It is written in js so can be run in the browser without leaving DFM.
  
Use by copy pasting the contents of script.min.js into the URL section of a bookmark. When you are on a DFM question, click the bookmark and it will get the answers.
